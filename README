== MiniTodo

Hi everybody. This is justa  work in progress.
Ideally, Id create:

- todos
- projects (like 'cost centers': work, personal, family, ...)
- tags   (@work, @travel, @urgent, @imp)

= INSTALL

 rake db:seed   # creates root and guest users, along with a few projects :)
 rails server
 # open http://localhost:3000/
